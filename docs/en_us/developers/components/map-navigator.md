# Developer Guide - MapNavigator Path Navigation System

## Introduction

This document explains how to use **MapNavigator**-related nodes, and how to record, edit, and export navigation paths that can be used directly in Pipeline with the built-in GUI tool.

**MapNavigator** is MaaEnd's current high-precision automatic navigation Action module. It continuously obtains the player's current zone, global coordinates, and facing direction from the underlying localization capability, then drives the character point by point along the developer-provided `path`, executing sprint, jump, interaction, and zone-transition actions at key points.

In addition to the traditional recorded-path workflow, MapNavigator now also supports BNAV v2-based `NAVMESH` semantic routing. The GUI can load `base.nav.gz` directly for triangle-based A\* preview, and the runtime expands `NAVMESH` nodes into ordinary `RUN` waypoints so preview, copy, and execution all share the same BaseNav data.

### Scope and Limitations

MapNavigator is responsible for "**given a route, move the character there reliably**" and belongs to the Action layer.

- It does **not** handle business flow orchestration. When to start moving, where to stop, and how to handle unexpected situations should still be decided by the outer Pipeline.
- It does **not** generate business logic automatically. The path itself still needs to be recorded or edited by the developer first, then passed into `custom_action_param.path`.
- It does **not** decide whether "this route should be used right now." For entry-condition checks, you should first use recognition or scene-related nodes, and only then enter the navigation action.

### Relationship Between MapNavigator and the Recording Tool

The repository includes a dedicated GUI tool at `/tools/MapNavigator`.

Its intended workflow is extremely direct:

1. Launch the game, then open the tool.
2. Click Start Recording.
3. Walk the route once in-game.
4. Stop recording, then fine-tune points, delete points, or add actions in the GUI.
5. Click Copy, then paste the exported `path` into Pipeline `custom_action_param.path`.

In other words, **most routes do not need to be written by hand**. For developers, the recommended workflow is "record first, arrange later, paste at the end."

## Node Description

The following sections detail the usage of nodes provided by MapNavigator. The current interface is a MAA `Custom` Action: `MapNavigateAction`.

### custom_action: MapNavigateAction

Moves the character automatically along the given path and executes extra actions on path points.

#### Node Parameters

**Required Parameters (in practice, you should at least provide `path`)**:

- `path`: A list of path nodes. MapNavigator consumes them in order and continues navigation until the route finishes or fails midway.

**Common Optional Parameters (`custom_action_param`)**:

- `map_name`: String, default empty. Used as the initial zone context. If your `path` already contains `ZONE` declaration nodes, you usually do not need to set it.
- `arrival_timeout`: Positive integer, default `60000`. Maximum allowed time for a single target point before it is considered unreachable, in milliseconds.
- `sprint_threshold`: Positive real number, default `25.0`. Threshold for the estimated contiguous runnable segment ahead, rather than only the straight-line distance to the current point.
- Other unknown top-level fields: currently ignored silently.

#### `path` Data Structure

`path` is essentially an array, and each element represents one "path node." In normal use, you usually do not need to write these by hand. It is much more recommended to arrange them with the GUI tool at `/tools/MapNavigator`. Common forms are shown below.

##### **1. The most common coordinate point**

```json
[
    688,
    350
]
```

This represents a normal movement point. Once the character reaches this coordinate, navigation proceeds to the next point.

##### **2. A coordinate point with an action**

```json
[
    720,
    350,
    "SPRINT"
]
```

This means a `SPRINT` action should be executed upon reaching that point. Common actions currently include:

- `RUN`: A normal movement point.
- `SPRINT`: Trigger one sprint upon arrival.
- `JUMP`: Jump upon arrival.
- `FIGHT`: Attack once upon arrival.
- `INTERACT`: Interact upon arrival.
- `TRANSFER`: Stop at the point and wait for an external mechanism to move the character to the next segment, then continue from following waypoints.
- `PORTAL`: A cross-zone transition point. Once committed, it enters blind-walk mode and waits for the zone switch.
- `HEADING`: Turn the camera to the specified heading, then tap `W` once.
- `COLLECT`: A gathering point. Upon precise arrival, stops the character and synchronously triggers the AutoCollect OCR + click subtask without exiting NaviController. See [Gathering Semantics](#gathering-semantics-collect--dig).
- `DIG`: A digging point. Same as `COLLECT` but triggers the digging subtask instead. See [Gathering Semantics](#gathering-semantics-collect--dig).

##### **3. Strict-arrival point**

```json
[
    700,
    350,
    "INTERACT",
    true
]
```

The trailing `true` means strict arrival is enabled for that point. For certain key points that really require precise arrival, such as interaction, jump, teleport, or zone-transition points, it is recommended to use strict arrival or directly use the corresponding action point, because the underlying logic already applies stricter arrival semantics there, such as slower approach and tighter arrival-radius confirmation.

##### **4. Zone declaration node**

```json
{
    "action": "ZONE",
    "zone_id": "Wuling_Base"
}
```

This is a **positionless control node** used to declare which zone the following path should belong to. It does not move the character by itself, but it provides zone-validation context for the subsequent path points.

##### **5. Heading control node `HEADING`**

```json
{
    "action": "HEADING",
    "angle": 90
}
```

Or:

```json
{
    "action": "HEADING",
    "target": [
        688,
        350
    ]
}
```

A positionless node. It turns the camera, then taps `W` once. `angle` provides a direct heading in degrees, while `target` computes that heading from the current position toward the given coordinate before reusing the same `HEADING` behavior.

##### **6. BaseNav semantic node `NAVMESH`**

```json
{
    "action": "NAVMESH",
    "target": [
        720,
        630
    ]
}
```

This is a **BaseNav semantic routing node**. It does not carry `zone_id`, `navmesh_zone`, or `path`; it only provides the target point `target`, while the rest is inferred automatically from the current localization state.

`NAVMESH` runs as follows:

1. The runtime first loads `assets/resource/model/map/navmesh/base.nav.gz`, and falls back to `base.nav` if needed.
2. It infers the current BaseNav zone from the localization context.
3. It runs A\* on the `.nav` triangle graph and only follows BaseNav links.
4. It expands the result into ordinary `RUN` waypoints before handing control to the old movement execution chain.

In the GUI, clicking `Load BaseNav` enters the same BaseNav preview flow, and `Copy NAVMESH` copies exactly this node shape to the clipboard.
`NAVMESH` is useful when you want the system to find a triangle-graph route from the current standing position to a target point without manually recording an entire path first.

**As long as the raw route is reachable without interactions, zone transitions, or special mechanisms, `NAVMESH` only needs a single `target` to carry the character directly to the destination**. You do not need to pre-record the whole path, add intermediate waypoints, or tune the route by hand for that goal. In the GUI, once you click the target, the runtime uses the BaseNav triangle graph to plan an executable route directly.

###### Cross-tier targets: `target_tier`

Without `target_tier`, `target` is interpreted in **base (base-map) coordinates** — that is the default shape above and its behavior is unchanged.

When the destination lives on a **tier (layered sub-map)**, each tier has its **own independent coordinate system**: the same numbers `[123, 456]` denote completely different physical points on the base map versus on a tier. In that case just add a `target_tier` field declaring **which tier's** frame the `target` is authored in:

```json
{
    "action": "NAVMESH",
    "target": [
        81.77,
        108.72
    ],
    "target_tier": "ValleyIV_L1_171"
}
```

- `target`: the coordinate you **click directly after switching to that tier's map in the GUI** — no manual conversion to base.
- `target_tier`: that tier's **zone name**, i.e. the `name` part after `:` in the GUI's `id:name` tier dropdown.
- At runtime the affine baked into the `.nav` for that tier projects `target` back onto base coordinates automatically (the same mirror logic that normalizes the start localization), and the goal snaps onto that tier's floor height.
- This is the only thing needed to target a tier: **one node with `target` + `target_tier`** — no extra `ZONE` node, no intermediate waypoints, no hand-tuned coordinates.
- The camelCase spelling `targetTier` is also accepted; an unknown tier name is logged as a warning and falls back to treating the target as base coordinates.

#### Return Behavior

`MapNavigateAction` is an Action node, so it does not expose a stable structured recognition output like a Recognition node does. In practice, its result is mainly reflected as:

- If the entire route is completed successfully, the Action returns success.
- If a fast-fail condition is hit midway (sustained no-progress timeout / sustained divergence timeout), the Action returns failure.

So in Pipeline, it is generally best treated as an atomic action: "**either the whole path finishes, or the node fails**."

#### Usage Example

The most common usage is simply to paste the `path` copied from the recording tool:

```json
{
    "DebugNavi": {
        "recognition": "DirectHit",
        "action": "Custom",
        "custom_action": "MapNavigateAction",
        "custom_action_param": {
            "path": [
                {
                    "action": "ZONE",
                    "zone_id": "Wuling_Base"
                },
                [
                    405,
                    1592
                ],
                [
                    400,
                    1583
                ],
                [
                    380,
                    1567,
                    "SPRINT"
                ],
                [
                    331,
                    1578,
                    true
                ]
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "MyNavigateNode": {
        "recognition": "DirectHit",
        "action": "Custom",
        "custom_action": "MapNavigateAction",
        "custom_action_param": {
            "arrival_timeout": 45000,
            "path": [
                {
                    "action": "ZONE",
                    "zone_id": "Wuling_Base"
                },
                [
                    405,
                    1592
                ],
                [
                    331,
                    1578,
                    "INTERACT",
                    true
                ]
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> [!TIP]
>
> In actual development, it is recommended to place `MapNavigateAction` after a node that has already confirmed the entry state. Confirm that the character is indeed in the expected scene, zone, and roughly correct orientation before starting a full navigation segment. This improves success rate significantly.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Adjacent path points should still be reasonably traversable one after another. Do not expect the navigator to clip through geometry, route around highly complex obstacles, or understand business-specific mechanisms automatically. For special segments such as portal transitions, jump pads, falling, or lift-like mechanisms, explicitly split them using `PORTAL`, `TRANSFER`, and separate business nodes.

## Tool Guide

We provide a dedicated GUI tool for MapNavigator at `/tools/MapNavigator`, with `main.py` as the entry point.

It supports:

1. Connecting directly to the current game window and recording real movement traces.
2. Automatically adding `ZONE` and `PORTAL` semantics based on zone changes.
3. Deleting points, dragging points, changing coordinate-point actions, and editing strict-arrival settings in the GUI.
4. Importing existing JSON / JSONC files, recursively searching recognizable `path` data, and continuing editing.
5. One-click copying of the canonical `path` that can be pasted directly into `custom_action_param.path`.
6. A separate `Assert Mode` for manually selecting a map and drawing a rectangle, then exporting a `MapLocateAssertLocation` node.
7. A BaseNav A\* mode that loads `.nav.gz` / `.nav`, previews routes on the red triangle overlay, and copies `NAVMESH` nodes.

One extra note: the current GUI editor mainly round-trips coordinate-bearing path points, plus the `ZONE` declarations derived from zone information.  
Positionless control nodes such as `HEADING`, and semantic routing nodes such as `NAVMESH`, are not part of the normal GUI point-editing workflow. It is safer to add or maintain `HEADING` manually after exporting the `path`, while `NAVMESH` can be generated directly through `Copy NAVMESH`.

### Running the Tool

#### 1) Standard Python

```powershell
cd tools\MapNavigator
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### 2) uv

```powershell
cd tools\MapNavigator
uv run main.py
```

### Before You Start

Before recording, make sure:

1. The workspace is set up per [getting-started](../getting-started.md), especially `install/agent/cpp-algo.exe` and `install/maafw`.
2. The Python dependencies `maafw`, `Pillow`, and `pynput` are installed.
3. **Windows**: The tool must be run **as Administrator**. Otherwise, the G/X hotkeys may not be captured by the system when the game (an elevated process) is in the foreground. `main.py` auto-detects this and triggers a UAC elevation prompt on startup.
4. **macOS**: On the first run, you need to grant permission in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring** for your terminal or Python interpreter, otherwise global hotkeys will have no effect.
5. The game is already running and the window is **not minimized** (if using Win32 connection).
6. `adb` is available and the target emulator/device is visible in the device list (if using ADB).
7. The character is already standing near the starting point of the route you want to record.

### Recommended Workflow

This is the most recommended and least painful way to use MapNavigator in practice.

#### Step 1: Open the tool and start recording

Run `tools/MapNavigator/main.py`, then click **`Start Recording`** in the top-left of the GUI.

The tool will automatically:

1. Launch the local Agent.
2. Search for the current game window.
3. Call the underlying localization logic continuously to read coordinates and zone information.
4. Sample the route you actually walked into a raw trajectory.

If the environment is incomplete or the game window cannot be found, the tool reports an error directly instead of producing invalid path data.

#### Step 2: Switch back to the game and walk the route once manually

After recording starts, go back to the game and simply **walk the route the way you want the character to execute it later**.

During recording, the following hotkeys are available:

| Hotkey | Function                                                                                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `G`    | 📋 **Copy the current coordinates** to the clipboard as `[x, y]` (does not affect recorded data, can be pressed any time) |
| `X`    | 📌 **Force-insert a strict-arrival waypoint** at the current exact position into the recorded data                        |

> [!TIP]
>
> Use `G` to quickly capture coordinates of interest without interrupting the recording flow. Use `X` to mark key positions (interaction points, portal triggers, etc.) so they are guaranteed to be recorded and marked as strict-arrival points.

One important note: points with stronger business semantics such as `FIGHT`, `TRANSFER`, and `HEADING` are **not inferred automatically during recording**. The usual workflow is to stop recording first, then manually change those points to the desired action in the GUI.

So the most basic workflow is simply:

1. Click Start Recording.
2. Go into the game and run the route normally.
3. Press `X` at key positions to force-pin them (e.g. interaction triggers, jump-pad landings).
4. Come back and click Stop when finished.

#### Step 3: Stop recording and review the automatically cleaned-up result

After clicking **`Stop Recording`**, the tool performs one round of cleanup on the raw trace, including:

- Normalizing coordinates, actions, `strict`, and `zone` data into the canonical format.
- Automatically adding `PORTAL` semantics on cross-zone boundaries.
- Splitting the view by the current zone for easier browsing.

What you see here is a normalized, editable, and exportable navigation route.

#### Step 4: Arrange the path in the GUI

At this point, you can handle the remaining details directly in the GUI.

**View operations:**

- Mouse wheel: zoom.
- Right mouse drag: pan the view.
- Left click on blank space: insert a new point.
- Left click on an existing point: select it.
- Left drag on an existing point: fine-tune its coordinate.

**Zone switching:**

- The `◀ / ▶` buttons at the top are used to switch between zones.
- If the route crosses zones, the tool displays each zone as a separate segment, making it easier to verify whether the transition before and after the zone boundary is reasonable.

**Point property editing:**

- The action dropdown at the top lets you set the action for the current point.
- `Set`: replace the current point's action with the selected one.
- `Append`: append another action semantic to the current point.
- `Pop`: remove the last action semantic from the current point's action chain.
- `Strict`: mark the current point as a strict-arrival point.
- `🗑`: delete the currently selected point.

The action dropdown currently targets coordinate-point actions, which in practice means `RUN / SPRINT / JUMP / FIGHT / INTERACT / PORTAL / TRANSFER / COLLECT / DIG`.  
Control nodes such as `HEADING` are outside this GUI action-chain model.

**Undo / Redo:**

- `Ctrl+Z`: undo.
- `Ctrl+Y`: redo.
- `C`: copy the coordinates of the currently selected point to the clipboard as `[x, y]` (supports multi-select for line-by-line output).

In practice, these are usually the only edits you really need:

1. Change key interaction points to `INTERACT` and enable `Strict` (points placed with the `X` hotkey during recording are already strict-arrival points).
2. Change points that need jumping, sprinting, external transfer, or zone-transition behavior into the corresponding action (for example `JUMP` / `SPRINT` / `TRANSFER` / `PORTAL`).
3. Check whether the points before and after a zone transition are placed reasonably.

#### Step 5: Copy the `path` and paste it into Pipeline

Once the route looks correct, click **`Copy Path`**.

What the tool copies to the clipboard is **the `path` body only**, not a full node JSON object. That means you can paste it directly into:

```json
"custom_action_param": {
    "path": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

This is also why it is recommended to finish all editing in the GUI before copying, because the exported content is already the canonical format that MapNavigator can consume directly.

### Import and Edit Existing Paths

If you already wrote a path in another Pipeline, or a teammate gives you a JSON / JSONC file, you can also click **`Import JSON`**.

The tool recursively scans the file for recognizable `path` data and automatically loads the candidate route with the most points. If the source data lacks zone information, the GUI will ask you to assign a zone for each route segment before continuing with editing and export.

This is especially useful for:

- Migrating old paths to the new navigation module.
- Reusing existing routes in collaborative development.
- Modifying a previously created route.

### Assert Mode

When you do not need to record a route, but instead need to check whether the character is currently inside a certain rectangular area, you can use the `Assert Mode` at the top of the tool.

Workflow:

1. Enable `Assert Mode`.
2. Select the target `zone` from the dropdown.
3. Drag a rectangle on the map.
4. Click `Copy Assert` to copy a complete `MapLocateAssertLocation` node to the clipboard.

This mode does not modify the current path data. It simply reuses the same map rendering workflow to generate area-assertion nodes quickly.

---

## Practical Development Advice

1. Record when possible. Try not to hand-write an entire path. Actually walking the route once is usually more accurate than filling coordinates in by feel. If the precision of path points recorded while running and sprinting feels insufficient, just walk more slowly.
2. Keep the starting point stable. Before recording, stabilize the character's position and camera as much as possible. This reduces later editing work.
3. Use special action points sparingly and precisely. Especially for `INTERACT`, `TRANSFER`, `PORTAL`, and `HEADING`, only place them where they are truly needed. Also remember that `HEADING` is a control node, so it is usually safest to maintain it manually after GUI export.
4. Always inspect zone-transition routes carefully. Automatically adding `PORTAL` only helps supplement semantics; it does not mean every cross-zone boundary is naturally valid.
5. The outer Pipeline still needs proper entry checks and failure fallback. Navigation is not your business flow itself, so do not push all exception handling into a single `MapNavigateAction`.

---

## Gathering Semantics: COLLECT / DIG

### Concept

`COLLECT` and `DIG` are **native gathering/digging semantic waypoints** in MapNavigator. A route author only needs to write gathering coordinates as `[x, y, "COLLECT"]` or `[x, y, "DIG"]` in the `path` array. Once the character arrives precisely, MapNavigator stops the character, synchronously runs the corresponding pipeline subtask to complete the gathering or digging, and then continues with the remaining path — **without exiting NaviController at any point**.

Compared to the old `anchor`-chain approach, this offers:

- No per-collection reconnection, re-Bootstrap, or sprint startup-grace reset
- Auto-sprint is suppressed for the entire segment leading up to a gathering point; the character will not overshoot
- Multiple gathering points fit in a single Pipeline node; no need to split into many `GotoFindN` nodes

### Syntax

In `custom_action_param.path`, set the third element of a target coordinate to the corresponding action string:

```json
"path": [
    { "action": "ZONE", "zone_id": "Wuling_Base" },
    [707, 838],
    [720, 832],
    [741, 802, "COLLECT"],
    [744, 800, "COLLECT"],
    [739, 792, "COLLECT"]
]
```

- `[x, y, "COLLECT"]`: upon arrival, triggers OCR recognition + auto-click gathering (`AutoCollectClickStart`)
- `[x, y, "DIG"]`: upon arrival, triggers unconditional two-click digging (`AutoCollectDigStart`)
- Any number of `COLLECT` and `DIG` points can be mixed in the same `MapNavigateAction` node
- **No** `anchor` or `next: ["AutoCollectClickStart"]` is needed on the Pipeline node

### Files the Route Author Should Care About

| File                                                          | Purpose                                                                    | When to Edit                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/resource/pipeline/AutoCollect/AutoCollectRoute*.json` | Route definitions with `MapNavigateAction` nodes and gathering coordinates | Adding routes, adjusting coordinates, adding or removing gathering points |
| `assets/resource/pipeline/AutoCollect/AutoCollectClick.json`  | `COLLECT` OCR + click subtask, entry: `AutoCollectClickStart`              | Adding or removing OCR-recognized material names                          |
| `assets/resource/pipeline/AutoCollect/AutoCollectDig.json`    | `DIG` digging subtask, entry: `AutoCollectDigStart`                        | When digging interaction logic changes                                    |

**In the vast majority of cases, a route author only needs to touch `AutoCollectRoute*.json`.**

### Files the Route Author Should Not Touch

The following files are maintained by the cpp-algo maintainer and do not need to be changed by route authors:

- `agent/cpp-algo/source/MapNavigator/navi_domain_types.h`: `ActionType` enum; `COLLECT`/`DIG` are declared here
- `agent/cpp-algo/source/MapNavigator/navi_config.h`: subtask entry names, `pipeline_override` JSON, post-collection sleep duration
- `agent/cpp-algo/source/MapNavigator/semantic_nodes.cpp`: the execution logic upon arrival at a gathering point

### Boundary Notes

**Old anchor-chain style is deprecated**

The old `anchor: { "AutoCollectClickAfter": "..." }` + `next: ["AutoCollectClickStart"]` split-node style is deprecated and should not appear in new routes.

**Do not change `AutoCollectClickEnd`'s `next`**

`AutoCollectClickEnd` in `AutoCollectClick.json` has `next: ["[Anchor]AutoCollectClickAfter"]` to maintain backward compatibility with the old anchor-chain calling convention. When the subtask is called via `MaaContextRunTask`, the cpp-algo layer temporarily overrides that `next` to empty via `pipeline_override`, so the subtask exits cleanly. Route authors **must not change** this field, as doing so would break any routes still using the old calling style.

**Sprint suppression is controlled by the runtime**

Auto-sprint suppression for the entire segment leading up to any `COLLECT`, `DIG`, or strict-arrival point is enforced at the `NavigationStateMachine` level in cpp-algo. Route authors cannot and do not need to control this from the path JSON.

### Full Steps to Add a New Gathering Route

1. Create `AutoCollectRouteN.json` in `assets/resource/pipeline/AutoCollect/`. Use an existing route as a reference; the skeleton is `Start` → `AssertLocation` → `Goto` → `End`.
2. Record the path with the MapNavigator tool. In the GUI, set gathering target points to the `Collect` or `Dig` action. Copy the `path` and paste it into the `Goto` node's `custom_action_param.path`.
3. Register the new route entry in `interface.json` or the relevant task entry JSON.
4. No changes are needed to `AutoCollectClick.json`, `AutoCollectDig.json`, or any cpp-algo source file.
